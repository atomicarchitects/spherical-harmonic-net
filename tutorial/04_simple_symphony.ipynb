    "Given a set $\\gS$ of points with 3D coordinates $\\{\\r_1, \\r_2, \\ldots, \\r_N\\}$ where each $\\r_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$, we wish to learn spatial distributions $\\pTi(\\r; \\gS)$ at each point $i$ conditioned on $\\gS$. Here, $\\Theta$ represents the parameters of our model.\n",

    "This problem is relevant to many applications that utilize point clouds:\n",
    "* In robotics, accurately estimating surface normal vectors at points in a point cloud is important for grasping and manipulation.\n",
    "* In chemistry, autoregressive models generate molecules by learning a distribution of the next atom conditioned on the current molecule.\n",
    "* In fluid dynamics, learning a distribution of the velocity field at a point conditioned on the current density field can be used to simulate fluid flow.\n",
    "* In computational dynamics, learning distortions of 3D meshes can speed up simulations of interacting objects.\n",
